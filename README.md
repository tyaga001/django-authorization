## Description

A Django project for managing a hospital system using [Permit.io](https://app.permit.io/) for authorization. The project includes a RESTful API for managing patients, doctors, and appointments. The API is secured using ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) policies. The project also includes a PDP (Policy Decision Point) microservice for evaluating access control policies. 

## Features

- ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
- CRUD operations
- RESTful API
- User authentication
- Role-based access control
- ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control)
